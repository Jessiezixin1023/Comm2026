This data can be used to extract different kinds of relationships, which can be grouped into layers, and which are basic components of the multidimensional social network proposed in the paper. The layers are created on the basis of two types of relations between humans, i.e. direct and object-based ones which respectively correspond to either social or semantic links between individuals. For better understanding of the complexity of the social network structure, layers and their profiles were identified and studied on two, spanned in time, snapshots of the Flickr population. Additionally, for each layer, a separate strength measure was proposed. The experiments on the Flickr photo sharing system revealed that the relationships between users result either from semantic links between objects they operate on or from social connections of these users. Moreover, the density of the social network increases in time. The second part of the study is devoted to building a social recommender system that supports the creation of new relations between users in a multimedia sharing system. Its main goal is to generate personalized suggestions that are continuously adapted to users' needs depending on the personal weights assigned to each layer in the multidimensional social network. The conducted experiments confirmed the usefulness of the proposed model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0093v1

In this chapter, we will discuss the role of social bots in content spreading dynamics in social media. In particular, we will first investigate some differences between diffusion dynamics of content generated by bots, as opposed to humans, in the context of political communication, then study the characteristics of bots behind the diffusion dynamics of social media spam campaigns.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08134v1

This was a coordinated effort, part of a Russian-led complex information operation. Utilizing the anonymity and outreach of social media platforms Russian operatives created an online astroturf that is in direct contact with regular Americans, promoting Russian agenda and goals. The elusiveness of this type of adversarial approach rendered security agencies helpless, stressing the unique challenges this type of intervention presents. Building on existing scholarship on the functions within influence networks on social media, we suggest a new approach to map those types of operations. We argue that pretending to be legitimate social actors obliges the network to adhere to social expectations, leaving a social footprint. To test the robustness of this social footprint we train artificial intelligence to identify it and create a predictive model. We use Twitter data identified as part of the Russian influence network for training the artificial intelligence and to test the prediction. Our model attains 88% prediction accuracy for the test set. Testing our prediction on two additional models results in 90.7% and 90.5% accuracy, validating our model. The predictive and validation results suggest that building a machine learning model around social functions within the Russian influence network can be used to map its actors and functions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07720v1

This sudden increase in SMS usage creates an opportunity for data leakage which could compromise personal and/or professional life. In this work, we have reviewed traditional penetration testing process and discussed the failures of traditional penetration testing process to test the 'People' layer of Simple Enterprise Security Architecture (SESA) model. In order to overcome these failures, we have developed the conceptual idea of online SMS user account penetration testing system that could be applied to online SMS user account and the user account could be categorised based on the rating points. This could help us to avoid leaking information that is sensitive and/or damage their reputation. Finally, we have also listed the best practice guidelines of online SMS usage.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3037v1

Critical studies in the literature often explore the issue using traditional data, such as questionnaires or interviews. Traditional approaches provide precious information; however, they impose challenges to obtaining large-scale data, making it hard to study worldwide patterns. Location-based social networks (LBSNs) can potentially mitigate such issues due to the relatively low cost of acquiring large amounts of behavioral data. Nevertheless, before using such data for studying tourists' behavior, it is necessary to verify whether the information adequately reveals the behavior measured with traditional data -- considered the ground truth. Thus, the present work investigates in which countries the global tourism network measured with an LBSN agreeably reflects the behavior estimated by the World Tourism Organization using traditional methods. Although we could find exceptions, the results suggest that, for most countries, LBSN data can satisfactorily represent the behavior studied. We have an indication that, in countries with high correlations between results obtained from both datasets, LBSN data can be used in research regarding the mobility of the tourists in the studied context.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06015v1

People use social media to express their feelings. Thus, social media constitute a valuable form of information for the early detection of stress and depression. Although many research works have been introduced targeting the early recognition of stress and depression, there are still limitations. There have been proposed multi-task learning settings, which use depression and emotion (or figurative language) as the primary and auxiliary tasks respectively. However, although stress is inextricably linked with depression, researchers face these two tasks as two separate tasks. To address these limitations, we present the first study, which exploits two different datasets collected under different conditions, and introduce two multitask learning frameworks, which use depression and stress as the main and auxiliary tasks respectively. Specifically, we use a depression dataset and a stressful dataset including stressful posts from ten subreddits of five domains. In terms of the first approach, each post passes through a shared BERT layer, which is updated by both tasks. Next, two separate BERT encoder layers are exploited, which are updated by each task separately. Regarding the second approach, it consists of shared and task-specific layers weighted by attention fusion networks. We conduct a series of experiments and compare our approaches with existing research initiatives, single-task learning, and transfer learning. Experiments show multiple advantages of our approaches over state-of-the-art ones.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18907v2

One of the emerging tasks is to distinguish between different kinds of activities, for example engineered misinformation campaigns versus spontaneous communication. Such detection problems require a formal definition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to person through the social network. Once a meme is identified, supervised learning methods can be applied to classify different types of communication. The appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from existing entities such as tags and keywords. Here we present a framework for the novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of social data. We evaluate various similarity measures that leverage content, metadata, network features, and their combinations. We also explore the idea of pre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. A systematic evaluation is carried out using a manually curated dataset as ground truth. Our analysis shows that pre-clustering and a combination of heterogeneous features yield the best trade-off between number of clusters and their quality, demonstrating that a simple combination based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as effective as a non-trivial optimization of parameters. Our approach is fully automatic, unsupervised, and scalable for real-time detection of memes in streaming data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2665v1

A range of topics, such as climate change, religion and vaccines has been subject to increasing politicization in the media and social media platforms. In this work, we propose a computational method for assessing politicization in online conversations based on topic shifts, i.e., the degree to which people switch topics in online conversations. The intuition is that topic shifts from a non-political topic to politics are a direct measure of politicization -- making something political, and that the more people switch conversations to politics, the more they perceive politics as playing a vital role in their daily lives. A fundamental challenge that must be addressed when one studies politicization in social media is that, a priori, any topic may be politicized. Hence, any keyword-based method or even machine learning approaches that rely on topic labels to classify topics are expensive to run and potentially ineffective. Instead, we learn from a seed of political keywords and use Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning to detect political comments in reaction to non-political news articles posted on Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok during the 2022 Brazilian presidential elections. Our findings indicate that all platforms show evidence of politicization as discussion around topics adjacent to politics such as economy, crime and drugs tend to shift to politics. Even the least politicized topics had the rate in which their topics shift to politics increased in the lead up to the elections and after other political events in Brazil -- an evidence of politicization.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11326v2

We tackle these problems by employing a graph exploration framework grounded in machine learning. Leveraging the structure of the subgraph gradually obtained from graph exploration, we construct prediction models to identify target hidden nodes in unknown social graphs. Through empirical investigations of real social graphs, we investigate the efficiency of graph exploration strategies in uncovering hidden nodes. Our results show that our graph exploration strategies discover hidden nodes with an efficiency comparable to that when the graph structure is known. Specifically, the query cost of discovering 10% of the hidden nodes is at most only 1.2 times that when the topology is known, and the query-cost multiplier for discovering 90% of the hidden nodes is at most only 1.4. Furthermore, our results suggest that using node embeddings, which are low-dimensional vector representations of nodes, for hidden-node discovery is a double-edged sword: it is effective in certain scenarios but sometimes degrades the efficiency of node discovery. Guided by this observation, we examine the effectiveness of using a bandit algorithm to combine the prediction models that use node embeddings with those that do not, and our analysis shows that the bandit-based graph exploration strategy achieves efficient node discovery across a wide array of settings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12571v2

By exploiting open-source software, DOSNs allow users to create their own servers, or instances, thus favoring the proliferation of platforms that are independent yet interconnected with each other in a transparent way. Nonetheless, the resulting cooperation model, commonly known as the Fediverse, still represents a world to be fully discovered, since existing studies have mainly focused on a limited number of structural aspects of interest in DOSNs. In this work, we aim to fill a lack of study on user relations and roles in DOSNs, by taking two main actions: understanding the impact of decentralization on how users relate to each other within their membership instance and/or across different instances, and unveiling user roles that can explain two interrelated axes of social behavioral phenomena, namely information consumption and boundary spanning. To this purpose, we build our analysis on user networks from Mastodon, since it represents the most widely used DOSN platform. We believe that the findings drawn from our study on Mastodon users' roles and information flow can pave a way for further development of fascinating research on DOSNs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15752v3

Here we describe a streaming framework for online detection and clustering of memes in social media, specifically Twitter. A pre-clustering procedure, namely protomeme detection, first isolates atomic tokens of information carried by the tweets. Protomemes are thereafter aggregated, based on multiple similarity measures, to obtain memes as cohesive groups of tweets reflecting actual concepts or topics of discussion. The clustering algorithm takes into account various dimensions of the data and metadata, including natural language, the social network, and the patterns of information diffusion. As a result, our system can build clusters of semantically, structurally, and topically related tweets. The clustering process is based on a variant of Online K-means that incorporates a memory mechanism, used to ""forget"" old memes and replace them over time with the new ones. The evaluation of our framework is carried out by using a dataset of Twitter trending topics. Over a one-week period, we systematically determined whether our algorithm was able to recover the trending hashtags. We show that the proposed method outperforms baseline algorithms that only use content features, as well as a state-of-the-art event detection method that assumes full knowledge of the underlying follower network. We finally show that our online learning framework is flexible, due to its independence of the adopted clustering algorithm, and best suited to work in a streaming scenario.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0652v1

Based on the data collected within the real social networking site both approaches were compared. The experimental results revealed that a highly motivated campaign not necessarily provides better results due to overlapping effect. Additional studies have shown that the behaviour of individual community members in the campaign based on their service profile can be predicted but the classification accuracy may be limited.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2369v1

They are continually changing and often reflect exogenous events that happen in the real world. Trends are localized in space and time as they are driven by activity in specific geographic areas that act as sources of traffic and information flow. Taken independently, trends and geography have been discussed in recent literature on online social media; although, so far, little has been done to characterize the relation between trends and geography. Here we investigate more than eleven thousand topics that trended on Twitter in 63 main US locations during a period of 50 days in 2013. This data allows us to study the origins and pathways of trends, how they compete for popularity at the local level to emerge as winners at the country level, and what dynamics underlie their production and consumption in different geographic areas. We identify two main classes of trending topics: those that surface locally, coinciding with three different geographic clusters (East coast, Midwest and Southwest); and those that emerge globally from several metropolitan areas, coinciding with the major air traffic hubs of the country. These hubs act as trendsetters, generating topics that eventually trend at the country level, and driving the conversation across the country. This poses an intriguing conjecture, drawing a parallel between the spread of information and diseases: Do trends travel faster by airplane than over the Internet?",http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2671v1

Influencers of a social media network, owing to their massive popularity, provide a huge potential customer base. However, it is not straightforward to decide which influencers should be selected for an advertizing campaign that can generate high returns with low investment. In this work, we present an agent-based model (ABM) that can simulate the dynamics of influencer advertizing campaigns in a variety of scenarios and can help to discover the best influencer marketing strategy. Our system is a probabilistic graph-based model that provides the additional advantage to incorporate real-world factors such as customers' interest in a product, customer behavior, the willingness to pay, a brand's investment cap, influencers' engagement with influence diffusion, and the nature of the product being advertized viz. luxury and non-luxury. Using customer acquisition cost and conversion ratio as a unit economic, we evaluate the performance of different kinds of influencers under a variety of circumstances that are simulated by varying the nature of the product and the customers' interest. Our results exemplify the circumstance-dependent nature of influencer marketing and provide insight into which kinds of influencers would be a better strategy under respective circumstances. For instance, we show that as the nature of the product varies from luxury to non-luxury, the performance of celebrities declines whereas the performance of nano-influencers improves. In terms of the customers' interest, we find that the performance of nano-influencers declines with the decrease in customers' interest whereas the performance of celebrities improves.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01750v3

Our research extends existing systems and goes beyond limiting binary classifications of coordinated and uncoordinated behaviors. It allows to expose different coordination patterns and to estimate the degree of coordination that characterizes diverse communities. We apply our framework to a dataset collected during the 2019 UK General Election, detecting and characterizing coordinated communities that participated in the electoral debate.

While these platforms offer unprecedented opportunities for democratic engagement, they have been implicated in increasing social polarization and the formation of ideological echo chambers. Previous research has primarily relied on observational studies of social media data or theoretical modeling approaches, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of how individuals respond to and are influenced by polarized online environments. Here we present a novel experimental framework for investigating polarization dynamics that allows human users to interact with LLM-based artificial agents in a controlled social network simulation. Through a user study with 122 participants, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully reproduce key characteristics of polarized online discourse while enabling precise manipulation of environmental factors. Our results provide empirical validation of theoretical predictions about online polarization, showing that polarized environments significantly increase perceived emotionality and group identity salience while reducing expressed uncertainty. These findings extend previous observational and theoretical work by providing causal evidence for how specific features of online environments influence user perceptions and behaviors. More broadly, this research introduces a powerful new methodology for studying social media dynamics, offering researchers unprecedented control over experimental conditions while maintaining ecological validity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15866v1

Alaa; Kartik Ahuja; Mihaela van der Schaar",2015,2015-11-08T02:49:22Z,"arXiv",0,ArXiv,"A social network confers benefits and advantages on individuals (and on groups), the literature refers to these advantages as social capital. This paper presents a micro-founded mathematical model of the evolution of a social network and of the social capital of individuals within the network. The evolution of the network is influenced by the extent to which individuals are homophilic, structurally opportunistic, socially gregarious and by the distribution of types in the society. In the analysis, we identify different kinds of social capital: bonding capital, popularity capital, and bridging capital. Bonding capital is created by forming a circle of connections, homophily increases bonding capital because it makes this circle of connections more homogeneous. Popularity capital leads to preferential attachment: individuals who become popular tend to become more popular because others are more likely to link to them. Homophily creates asymmetries in the levels of popularity attained by different social groups, more gregarious types of agents are more likely to become popular. However, in homophilic societies, individuals who belong to less gregarious, less opportunistic, or major types are likely to be more central in the network and thus acquire a bridging capital.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02429v1

There is a vast literature on the subject, but most known methods have an important drawback: the inferred graph is not guaranteed to explain every interaction from the input trace. We consider this an important issue since such inferred graph cannot be used as input for applications that require a reliable estimate of the true graph. On the other hand, a graph having trace feasibility guarantees can help us better understand the true (hidden) interactions that may have taken place between nodes of interest. The inference of such graph is the goal of this paper. Firstly, given an activity log from a social network, we introduce a set of constraints that take into consideration all the hidden paths that are possible between the nodes of the trace, given their timestamps of interaction. Then, we develop a nontrivial modification of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm by Newman [1], that we call Constrained-EM, which incorporates the constraints and a set of auxiliary variables into the inference process to guide it towards the feasibility of the trace. Experimental results on real-world data from Twitter confirm that Constrained-EM generates a posterior distribution of graphs that explains all the events observed in the trace while presenting the desired properties of a scale-free, small-world graph.

Recently, the area of multi-layered social network has started attracting more and more attention in research conducted within different domains [Kazienko 11a], [Szell 10], [Rodriguez 07], [Rodriguez 09], and the meaning of multiplex network has expanded and covers not only social relationships but any kind of connection, e.g. based on geography, occupation, kinship, hobbies, etc. [Abraham 12]. This essay aims to summarize existing knowledge about one concept which has many different names i.e. the concept of Multi-layered Social Network also known as Layered social network, Multi-relational social network, Multidimensional social network, Multiplex social network",http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2425v3

In this chapter, we summarize recent studies using large public Twitter data sets on these issues. We have three primary objectives. First, we delineate epistemological and practical considerations when combining the traditions of computational research and social science research. A sensible balance should be struck when the stakes are high between advancing social theory and concrete, timely reporting of ongoing events. We additionally comment on the computational challenges of gleaning insight from large amounts of social media data. Second, we characterize the role of social bots in social media manipulation around the discourse on the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Third, we compare results from 2020 to prior years to note that, although bot accounts still contribute to the emergence of echo-chambers, there is a transition from state-sponsored campaigns to domestically emergent sources of distortion. Furthermore, issues of public health can be confounded by political orientation, especially from localized communities of actors who spread misinformation. We conclude that automation and social media manipulation pose issues to a healthy and democratic discourse, precisely because they distort representation of pluralism within the public sphere.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08436v1

The different ways for users to interact, such as liking, retweeting and favoriting user-generated content, are among the defining and extremely popular features of these sites. While empirical studies have been done to learn about the network growth processes in these sites, few studies have focused on social interaction behaviour and the effect of social interaction on network growth. In this paper, we analyze large-scale data collected from the Flickr social network to learn about individual favoriting behaviour and examine the occurrence of link formation after a favorite is created. We do this using a systematic formulation of Flickr as a two-layer temporal multiplex network: the first layer describes the follow relationship between users and the second layer describes the social interaction between users in the form of favorite markings to photos uploaded by them. Our investigation reveals that (a) favoriting is well-described by preferential attachment, (b) over 50% of favorites are reciprocated within 10 days if at all they are reciprocated, (c) different kinds of favorites differ in how fast they are reciprocated, and (d) after a favorite is created, multiplex triangles are closed by the creation of follow links by the favoriter's followers to the favorite receiver.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07577v2

In this review, we discuss the design space of experiments to measure social influence through combinations of interventions and randomizations. We define an experiment as combination of (1) a target population of individuals connected by an observed interaction network, (2) a set of treatments whereby the researcher will intervene in the social system, (3) a randomization strategy which maps individuals or edges to treatments, and (4) a measurement of an outcome of interest after treatment has been assigned.

Uncovering such relations can provide better insights to understand communities and the structure of social media. According to social science findings, the attitudes that members from different communities express towards each other are largely shaped by their community membership. Hence, we hypothesize that inter-community attitudes expressed among users in social media have the potential to reflect their inter-community relations. Therefore, we first validate this hypothesis in the context of social media.

This paper presents a community detection method based on nonnegative matrix tri-factorization for multiple heterogeneous social networks, which formulates a common consensus matrix to represent the global fused community. Specifically, the proposed method involves creating adjacency matrices based on network structure and content similarity, followed by alignment matrices which distinguish overlapping users in different social networks. With the generated alignment matrices, the method could enhance the fusion degree of the global community by detecting overlapping user communities across networks.

To manage any crisis, governments and public health researchers exploit the information available to them in order to make informed decisions, also defined as situational awareness. Gathering situational awareness using social media has been functional to manage epidemics. Previous research focused on using discussions during periods of epidemic crises on social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Facebook and developing NLP techniques to filter out relevant discussions from a huge corpus of messages and posts. Social media usage varies with internet penetration and other socioeconomic factors, which might induce disparity in analyzing discussions across different geographies. However, print media is a ubiquitous information source, irrespective of geography. Further, topics discussed in news articles are already newsworthy, while on social media newsworthiness is a product of techno-social processes. Developing this fundamental difference, we study Twitter data during the second wave in India focused on six high-population cities with varied macroeconomic factors. Through a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods, we further analyze two Indian newspapers during the same period and compare topics from both Twitter and the newspapers to evaluate situational awareness around the second phase of COVID on each of these platforms.

One retains the established assumptions, while the other incorporates principles of reflexivity theory and cognitive social structures. In addition, we utilize a microbial genetic algorithm to optimize the behaviour of the physician and patient agents in both models.

Despite being effective, existing social recommendation models are mainly devised for recommending regular items such as blogs, images, and products, and largely fail for community recommendations due to overlooking the unique characteristics of communities. Distinctly, communities are constituted by individuals, who present high dynamicity and relate to rich structural patterns in social networks. To our knowledge, limited research has been devoted to comprehensively exploiting this information for recommending communities. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CASO, a novel and effective model specially designed for social community recommendation. Under the hood, CASO harnesses three carefully-crafted encoders for user embedding, wherein two of them extract community-related global and local structures from the social network via social modularity maximization and social closeness aggregation, while the third one captures user preferences using collaborative filtering with observed user-community affiliations. To further eliminate feature redundancy therein, we introduce a mutual exclusion between social and collaborative signals. Finally, CASO includes a community detection loss in the model optimization, thereby producing community-aware embeddings for communities. Our extensive experiments evaluating CASO against nine strong baselines on six real-world social networks demonstrate its consistent and remarkable superiority over the state of the art in terms of community recommendation performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05107v2

We propose a new measure of centrality --- limited-attention version of Bonacich's Alpha-centrality --- that models the effect of limited attention on epidemic diffusion. The new measure describes a process in which nodes broadcast messages to their out-neighbors, but the neighbors' ability to receive the message depends on the number of in-neighbors they have.

Social scientists have developed influential theories about the role of network structure in information access. These theories were validated through numerous studies, which examined how individuals leverage their social networks for competitive advantage, such as a new job or higher compensation. It is not clear how these theories generalize to online networks, which differ from real-world social networks in important respects, including asymmetry of social links. We address this problem by analyzing how users of the social news aggregator Digg adopt stories recommended by friends, i.e., users they follow. We measure the impact different factors, such as network position and activity rate; have on access to novel information, which in Digg's case means set of distinct news stories. We show that a user can improve his information access by linking to active users, though this becomes less effective as the number of friends, or their activity, grows due to structural network constraints. These constraints arise because users in structurally diverse position within the follower graph have topically diverse interests from their friends. Moreover, though in most cases user's friends are exposed to almost all the information available in the network, after they make their recommendations, the user sees only a small fraction of the available information.

The learning effectiveness and efficiency of existing alignment models will be degraded significantly as the network size increases.

Instead of aligning the complete input network, SHNA proposes to identify the anchor links between the matched sub-network pairs, while those between the unmatched sub-networks will be pruned to effectively shrink the search space.

Our results show that (i) most of the influential source spreaders are not influential brokers (and vice versa) and (ii) the overlap between central nodes and influential brokers is small (less than 15%) in Twitter datasets. We also tackle the problem of identifying influential brokers from centrality measures and node embeddings, and we examine the effectiveness of social network features in the broker identification task. Our results show that (iii) although a single centrality measure cannot characterize influential brokers well, prediction models using node embedding features achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.35--0.68, suggesting the effectiveness of social network features for identifying influential brokers.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00630v1

In this multidisciplinary study, we consider the question of constructing traditional social networks from OSN data and then present several measurement case studies showing how variations in collected OSN data affects social network analyses. To this end we developed a systematic com parison methodology, which we applied to five pairs of parallel datasets collected from Twitter in four case studies.

Thus, understanding the structures and evolutions of reciprocal edges and parasocial ones, exploring the factors that influence parasocial edges to become reciprocal ones, and predicting whether a parasocial edge will turn into a reciprocal one are basic research problems. However, there have been few systematic studies about such problems. In this paper, we bridge this gap using a novel large-scale Google+ dataset crawled by ourselves as well as one publicly available social network dataset. First, we compare the structures and evolutions of reciprocal edges and those of parasocial edges. For instance, we find that reciprocal edges are more likely to connect users with similar degrees while parasocial edges are more likely to link ordinary users (e.g., users with low degrees) and popular users (e.g., celebrities). However, the impacts of reciprocal edges linking ordinary and popular users on the network structures increase slowly as the social networks evolve. Second, we observe that factors including user behaviors, node attributes, and edge attributes all have significant impacts on the formation of reciprocal edges. Third, in contrast to previous studies that treat reciprocal edge prediction as either a supervised or a semi-supervised learning problem, we identify that reciprocal edge prediction is better modeled as an outlier detection problem. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations with the two datasets, and we show that our proposal outperforms previous reciprocal edge prediction approaches.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6309v4

This reinforces the importance of online social support. Online social support is effective for people who lack social resources because of the anonymity of online communities. We aimed to understand online social support via avatars and their social relationships to provide better social support to avatar users. Therefore, we administered a questionnaire to three avatar communication service users (Second Life, ZEPETO, and Pigg Party) and three text communication service users (Facebook, X, and Instagram) (N=8,947). There was no duplication of users for each service. By comparing avatar and text communication users, we examined the amount of online social support, stability of online relationships, and the relationships between online social support and offline social resources (e.g., offline social support). We observed that avatar communication service users received more online social support, had more stable relationships, and had fewer offline social resources than text communication service users. However, the positive association between online and offline social support for avatar communication users was more substantial than for text communication users. These findings highlight the significance of realistic online communication experiences through avatars, including nonverbal and real-time interactions with co-presence.

Traditionally, researchers have used predefined network-based user features (e.g., network size, degree, and centrality measures). However, because such measures may not capture the complex characteristics of social media users, in our study we developed a method for embedding users based on a URL domain co-occurrence network. This approach effectively represents social media users involved in competing events such as political campaigns and public health crises. We assessed the method's performance using binary classification tasks and datasets that covered topics associated with the COVID-19 infodemic, such as QAnon, Biden, and Ivermectin, among Twitter users.

Hostile actors, such as extremist groups or foreign governments, utilize these networks to run propaganda campaigns with different aims. For extremists, these campaigns are designed for recruiting new members or inciting violence. For foreign governments, the aim may be to create instability in rival nations. Proper social network counter-measures are needed to combat these threats. Here we present one important counter-measure: penetrating social networks. This means making target users connect with or follow agents deployed in the social network. Once such connections are established with the targets, the agents can influence them by sharing content which counters the influence campaign. In this work we study how to penetrate a social network, which we call the follow-back problem. The goal here is to find a policy that maximizes the number of targets that follow the agent. We conduct an empirical study to understand what behavioral and network features affect the probability of a target following an agent. We find that the degree of the target and the size of the mutual neighborhood of the agent and target in the network affect this probability. Based on our empirical findings, we then propose a model for targets following an agent. Using this model, we solve the follow-back problem exactly on directed acyclic graphs and derive a closed form expression for the expected number of follows an agent receives under the optimal policy. We then formulate the follow-back problem on an arbitrary graph as an integer program. To evaluate our integer program based policies, we conduct simulations on real social network topologies in Twitter. We find that our polices result in more effective network penetration, with significant increases in the expected number of targets that follow the agent.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02608v1

We develop a BERT-based ensemble classifier to automatically identify types of support offered in users' comments. We then analyze the effect of personal information sharing and posts' topical, lexical, and sentiment markers on the acquisition of support and five interaction measures (submission scores, the number of comments, the number of unique commenters, the length and sentiments of comments).

A large body of research shows that women's offline networks are less advantageous than men's. How online platforms such as LinkedIn may reflect or reproduce gendered networking behaviours, or how online social connectivity may affect outcomes differentially by gender is not well understood. This paper analyses aggregate, anonymised data from almost 10 million LinkedIn users in the UK and US information technology (IT) sector collected from the site's advertising platform to explore how being connected to Big Tech companies ('social connectivity') varies by gender, and how gender, age, seniority and social connectivity shape the propensity to report job promotions or relocations. Consistent with previous studies, we find there are fewer women compared to men on LinkedIn in IT. Furthermore, female users are less likely to be connected to Big Tech companies than men. However, when we further analyse recent promotion or relocation reports, we find women are more likely than men to have reported a recent promotion at work, suggesting high-achieving women may be self-selecting onto LinkedIn. Even among this positively selected group, though, we find men are more likely to report a recent relocation. Social connectivity emerges as a significant predictor of promotion and relocation reports, with an interaction effect between gender and social connectivity indicating the payoffs to social connectivity for promotion and relocation reports are larger for women. This suggests that online networking has the potential for larger impacts for women, who experience greater disadvantage in traditional networking contexts, and calls for further research to understand differential impacts of online networking for socially disadvantaged groups.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13296v1

Similar to the original paradox, the strong friendship paradox generalizes beyond popularity.

However, they neglect the positions of community members towards keywords, which play an important role for understanding communities in the highly polarized atmosphere of social media. To this end, we present a sentiment-driven community profiling and detection framework which aims to provide community profiles presenting positive and negative collective opinions of community members separately. With this regard, our framework initially extracts key expressions in users' messages as representative of issues and then identifies users' positive/negative attitudes towards these key expressions.

This study investigates how different levels of label detail (basic, moderate, maximum) and content stakes (high vs. low) influence user engagement with and perceptions of AI-generated images through a within-subjects experimental study with 105 participants. Our findings reveal that increasing label detail enhances user perceptions of label transparency but does not affect user engagement. However, content stakes significantly impact user engagement and perceptions, with users demonstrating higher engagement and trust in low-stakes images. These results suggest that social media platforms can adopt detailed labels to improve transparency without compromising user engagement, offering insights for effective labeling strategies for AI-generated content.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19024v1

As a result, the quality of content and annotations they create to organize content is also highly variable. While several approaches have been proposed to mine social annotations, for example, to learn folksonomies that reflect how people relate narrower concepts to broader ones, these methods treat all users and the annotations they create uniformly. We propose a framework to automatically identify experts, i.e., knowledgeable users who create high quality annotations, and use their knowledge to guide folksonomy learning. We evaluate the approach on a large body of social annotations extracted from the photosharing site Flickr. We show that using expert knowledge leads to more detailed and accurate folksonomies. Moreover, we show that including annotations from non-expert, or novice, users leads to more comprehensive folksonomies than experts' knowledge alone.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4851v1

These users are not healthy for the Twitter network since they flaw notions of influence and visibility. Indeed, it has recently been observed that they are real and active users that can help malicious users such as spammers gaining influence. Studying their behavior and understanding their position in Twitter is thus of important interest. A recent work provided an efficient way to detect social capitalists using two simple topological measures. Based on this detection method, we study how social capitalists are distributed over Twitter's friend-to-follower network. We are especially interested in analyzing how they are organized, and how their links spread across the network. Answering these questions allows to know whether the social capitalism methods increase the actual visibility on the service. To that aim, we study the position of social capitalists on Twitter w.r.t. the community structure of the network. We base our work on the concept of community role of a node, which describes its position in a network depending on its connectivity at the community level. The topological measures originally defined to characterize these roles consider only some aspects of community-related connectivity and rely on a set of empirically fixed thresholds. We first show the limitations of such measures and then extend and generalize them by considering new aspects of the community-related connectivity. Moreover, we use an unsupervised approach to distinguish the roles, in order to provide more flexibility relatively to the studied system. We then apply our method to the case of social capitalists and show that they are highly visible on Twitter, due to the specific roles they occupy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6611v1

Rabiee; Ali Khodadadi",2016,2016-07-29T14:20:52Z,"arXiv",0,ArXiv,"People usually get involved in multiple social networks to enjoy new services or to fulfill their needs. Many new social networks try to attract users of other existing networks to increase the number of their users. Once a user (called source user) of a social network (called source network) joins a new social network (called target network), a new inter-network link (called anchor link) is formed between the source and target networks. In this paper, we concentrated on predicting the formation of such anchor links between heterogeneous social networks. Unlike conventional link prediction problems in which the formation of a link between two existing users within a single network is predicted, in anchor link prediction, the target user is missing and will be added to the target network once the anchor link is created. To solve this problem, we use meta-paths as a powerful tool for utilizing heterogeneous information in both the source and target networks. To this end, we propose an effective general meta-path-based approach called Connector and Recursive Meta-Paths (CRMP). By using those two different categories of meta-paths, we model different aspects of social factors that may affect a source user to join the target network, resulting in the formation of a new anchor link.

Moreover, the personalized recommendations that most social media sites provide also contribute towards the information consumed by individual users. In this work, we define a concept of information diet -- which is the topical distribution of a given set of information items (e.g., tweets) -- to characterize the information produced and consumed by various types of users in the popular Twitter social media. At a high level, we find that (i) popular users mostly produce very specialized diets focusing on only a few topics; in fact, news organizations (e.g., NYTimes) produce much more focused diets on social media as compared to their mass media diets, (ii) most users' consumption diets are primarily focused towards one or two topics of their interest, and (iii) the personalized recommendations provided by Twitter help to mitigate some of the topical imbalances in the users' consumption diets, by adding information on diverse topics apart from the users' primary topics of interest.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01442v1

Currently, ESG is determined using self-reported corporate filings, which allows companies to portray themselves in an artificially positive light. As a result, ESG evaluation is subjective and inconsistent across raters, giving executives mixed signals on what to improve. This project aims to create a data-driven ESG evaluation system that can provide better guidance and more systemized scores by incorporating social sentiment. Social sentiment allows for more balanced perspectives which directly highlight public opinion, helping companies create more focused and impactful initiatives. To build this, Python web scrapers were developed to collect data from Wikipedia, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google News for the S&amp;P 500 companies. Data was then cleaned and passed through NLP algorithms to obtain sentiment scores for ESG subcategories. Using these features, machine-learning algorithms were trained and calibrated to S&amp;P Global ESG Ratings to test their predictive capabilities. The Random-Forest model was the strongest model with a mean absolute error of 13.4% and a correlation of 26.1% (p-value 0.0372), showing encouraging results. Overall, measuring ESG social sentiment across sub-categories can help executives focus efforts on areas people care about most.

One of the major reasons behind distracted driving is the use of cell-phones, accounting for 14% of fatal crashes. Social media applications have enabled users to stay connected, however, the use of such applications while driving could have serious repercussions -- often leading the user to be distracted from the road and ending up in an accident. In the context of impression management, it has been discovered that individuals often take a risk (such as teens smoking cigarettes, indulging in narcotics, and participating in unsafe sex) to improve their social standing. Therefore, viewing the phenomena of posting distracted driving posts under the lens of self-presentation, it can be hypothesized that users often indulge in risk-taking behavior on social media to improve their impression among their peers. In this paper, we first try to understand the severity of such social-media-based distractions by analyzing the content posted on a popular social media site where the user is driving and is also simultaneously creating content. To this end, we build a deep learning classifier to identify publicly posted content on social media that involves the user driving. Furthermore, a framework proposed to understand factors behind voluntary risk-taking activity observes that younger individuals are more willing to perform such activities, and men (as opposed to women) are more inclined to take risks. Grounding our observations in this framework, we test these hypotheses on 173 cities across the world. We conduct spatial and temporal analysis on a city-level and understand how distracted driving content posting behavior changes due to varied demographics. We discover that the factors put forth by the framework are significant in estimating the extent of such behavior.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04579v1

Results show that a basic social probing activity can be used to acquire social relevance on the network and that the so-acquired popularity can be effectively leveraged to drive users in their social connectivity choices.

Interesting solutions have been proposed in the past, which own the necessary mechanisms to allow users keeping control over their personal information and setting the rules to regulate the access of other users. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of this type of solutions is severely reduced by the fact that different user communities with a shared interest could be disconnected/separated from each other.

First, this study shows that regardless of level of ambiguity both for people or networked society, only two types of opinions can be formed, and both are biased. However, one opinion type is less biased than the other depending on the state of the world. The size of both biases depends on the ambiguity level and relative magnitude of the state and confirmation biases. Hence, long-run learning is not attained even when people impartially interpret ambiguity. Finally, analytically confirming the probability of emergence of the less-biased consensus when people are connected and have different priors is difficult. Hence, I used simulations to analyze its determinants and found three main results: i) some network topologies are more conducive to consensus efficiency, ii) some degree of partisanship enhances consensus efficiency even under confirmation bias and iii) open-mindedness (i.e. when partisans agree to exchange opinions with opposing partisans) might inhibit efficiency in some cases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12594v3

We explore if prompting perspective-taking on social media platforms can help enhance empathy between opposing groups as a first step towards reducing affective polarization. Specifically, we deploy a randomized field experiment through a browser extension to 1,611 participants on Twitter, which enables participants to randomly replace their feeds with those belonging to accounts whose political views either agree with or diverge from their own. We find that simply exposing participants to ""outgroup"" feeds enhances engagement, but not an understanding of why others hold their political views. On the other hand, framing the experience in familiar, empathic terms by prompting participants to recall a disagreement with a friend does not affect engagement, but does increase their ability to understand opposing views.

Fenomena ini terjadi pada beberapa level konteks, seperti interpersonal, group, public or rhetoric, organizational, dan mass. Salah satu teori yang menjelaskan fenomena human communication pada level interpersonal adalah teori penetrasi sosial atau Social Penetration Theory, yang diusulkan oleh Irwin Altman dan Dalmas Taylor. Teori ini menggambarkan pola pengembangan hubungan yang melibatkan proses penetrasi sosial, di mana individu bergerak dari komunikasi superficial ke komunikasi yang lebih intim. Penelitian ini menggunakan pendekatan kualitatif dengan desain studi kasus untuk mengeksplorasi penerapan Social Penetration Theory dalam konteks kehidupan sehari-hari. Data dikumpulkan melalui wawancara mendalam dan observasi partisipan, lalu dianalisis menggunakan pendekatan analisis tematik. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa teori penetrasi sosial memperlihatkan tahapan-tahapan proses komunikasi yang melibatkan pembukaan diri dari tingkat yang dangkal hingga yang lebih dalam, dan penerapan teori ini dapat ditemui dalam berbagai hubungan interpersonal. Meskipun memiliki kelebihan dalam memahami dinamika hubungan interpersonal, teori ini juga memiliki kelemahan dalam mempertimbangkan faktor-faktor lain yang memengaruhi pengungkapan diri.

The ordinary least squares model and the binary logistic regression model are used to test the proposed hypotheses.FindingsThe study suggests that both mothers' superficial level disclosure and personal level disclosure positively affect online social support received, and the effect of personal level disclosure on social support is much greater than that of superficial level disclosure. Online social support received is related to the content of the post and reduces mothers' depressive mood. The authors further find that the association between personal level disclosure and depressive mood is fully mediated by social support.Research limitations/implicationsThe data are collected from a parenting social network. Although it is the major parenting social media with the most users in China, the generalizability of this model and the findings to other social media need additional research.Practical implicationsThis study offers implications for researchers and practitioners with regard to social media uses and impacts, which also has important implications for policy and interventions for the mental health of mothers.Originality/valueThis paper makes theoretical contributions to the literature of social penetration theory and social support by (1) dividing self-disclosure into superficial level disclosure and personal level disclosure according to the intimacy of self-disclosure; (2) empirically investigating the direct effect of online self-disclosure on social support and the mediating effect of social support between online self-disclosure and mothers' depressive mood.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cc10f67ad5aa397b8a0e39c61972eff1544db2be

Our endogeneity-corrected results documented that high social media penetration, on average, enhances all forms of democracy. In descending order, social media penetration has contributed more to enhancing democracy in high-income economies, followed by lower-middle and upper-middle income economies. In low-income economies, social media penetration has a negative effect on democracy indices. We also documented heterogeneity in the findings based on regions.

It presents the results of an empirical research project based on data collected longitudinally (spanning the period 2002-2012) from 458 personal semi-constructed in-depth interviews with Internet users from 24 countries. The findings reveal a significant shift in users’ perceptions concerning the degree of ""security"" and ""familiarity"" of the Web between the pre- and the post- Web 2.0 eras. Additionally, the paper discusses the significant changes brought about with regard to two fundamental concepts in communication theory: the concept of the “audience”, and the long-standing dichotomy between the 'private' and 'public' spheres of social life. Based on Social Penetration Theory the paper proposes an integrative model for comprehending the mechanisms of personal information management in interpersonal communication, applicable to both online (Computer-Mediated) and offline (Face-To-Face) contexts of communication.

Yao",2022,2022-06-17,"Applied Sciences",7,Semantic Scholar,"The penetration test has many repetitive operations and requires advanced expert knowledge, therefore, the manual penetration test is inefficient. With the development of reinforcement learning, the intelligent penetration test has been a research hotspot. However, the existing intelligent penetration test simulation environments only focus on the exploits of target hosts by the penetration tester agent’s actions while ignoring the important role of social engineering in the penetration test in reality. In addition, the construction of the existing penetration test simulation environment is based on the traditional network graph model without integrating security factors and attributes, and it is difficult to express the interaction between the penetration tester and the target network. This paper constructs an improved network graph model for penetration test (NMPT), which integrates the relevant security attributes of the penetration test. The NMPT model lays the foundation for extending the penetration tester’s social engineering actions. Then, we propose an intelligent penetration test method that incorporates social engineering factors (SE-AIPT) based on the Markov Decision Process. We adopt several mainstream reinforcement learning algorithms to train attack agents. The experiments show that the SE-AIPT method could vividly model the penetration tester agent’s social engineering actions, which effectively improves the reality of the simulation environment. Moreover, the penetration tester agent shows superior effects in the attack path discovery in the intelligent penetration test simulation environment constructed by the SE-AIPT method.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d205ed456b78b11010000e26ed21ebc64a88e8e4

Globally, buildings consume up to 40% of the world’s total energy. By 2030, it is expected to increase to 50%. Therefore, the world is facing a great challenge to overcome these problems related to global energy production. Malaysia is one of the top consumers of primary energy in Asia. In 2018, primary energy consumption for Malaysia was 3.79 quadrillion btu at an average annual rate of 4.58%. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review on several previous studies of energy consumption in the world, especially in Malaysia, and how geographical information system (GIS) methods have been used for the spatial assessment of energy efficiency. Indeed, strategies of energy efficiency are essential in energy policy that could be created using various approaches used for energy savings in buildings. The findings of this review reveal that, for estimating energy consumption, exploring renewable energy sources, and investigating solar radiation, several geographic information system techniques such as multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) are mainly utilized. The result indicates that the fuzzy DS method can more reliably determine the optimal PV farm locations. The 3D models are also regarded as an effective tool for estimating solar radiation, since this method generates a 3D model exportable to software tools.

We collected 375 valid responses through an offline survey, and the structural equation modeling technique was used to empirically test the proposed model. The empirical results indicate that consumer adoption of EVs can be effectively predicted by three important innovation characteristics, namely perceived compatibility, perceived complexity, and perceived relative advantage. Furthermore, the results also suggest that factors in the economic aspect (monetary subsidy and risk of a price reduction), functional aspect (intelligent function and risk of sustainability), and social aspect (status symbol and risk of reputation), exert significant impacts on the adoption of EVs by influencing consumers’ perceptions of innovation characteristics. Theoretically, this study contributes to the literature by providing an appropriate theoretical perspective for understanding consumer adoption of EVs and identifying numerous significant antecedents of such behavior.

Due to the intermittency of these renewable sources, the battery energy storage system often coexists alongside solar/wind energy systems. Integrating these two aspects into power systems requires the consideration of reliability, social wellbeing and environmental factors, which collectively form a multi-objective optimization problem that this paper aims to solve with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. The proposed method is able to find optimum solutions that are equally beneficial to all factors – Pareto front – without being heavily biased to any one of them. The proposed method is separated into two parts by first optimizing the penetration of solar/wind energy, followed by the optimization of the energy storage capacity in the second part. The fuzzy decision making method is utilized to select a preferred solution from the Pareto front based on the assignment of the membership function values to reflect operator’s preferences.

Moreover, each edge server sends these reputation scores to the cloud, which updates the associated reputation values of the SOs, deriving from experiences coming from all the edge domains.

However, it is unclear if such initiatives are also beneficial for SM profile owners such as influencers, who are the prime content creators on the SM platforms who use SM posts to build their influence within their network of followers. Our study investigates the effect of introducing one such new SM feature: the “story” on the creation and consumption of SM posts. Leveraging social penetration theory, we hypothesize the influence of introducing story feature on (1) the frequency of SM post creation by profile owners and (2) the extent of follower engagement with SM posts. Employing a quasi-experimental design, we find that the introduction of the story feature reduces the frequency of SM post creation, but the enhanced self-disclosure through the story feature increases follower engagement with the SM posts. However, these effects are moderated by the situating culture of the SM communities: while low-power-distance cultures value profile owners’ self-disclosure, high-power-distance cultures exhibit a mixed influence. Advancing literature on social penetration theory and SM user engagement, our study demonstrates that new self-disclosive SM content creation features do not necessarily benefit all the concerned stakeholders and that the effectiveness of such features might vary from one community to another. Hence, the intended impact of introducing new SM features needs to be carefully evaluated by SM platforms in a holistic manner.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50a04fde393b22d1a04555824b29b92af8e53d76

The current study engaged a community sample (N = 169) of trans feminine and nonbinary individuals assigned male at birth (TFNB) to investigate predictors of sexual experiences after addressing methodological biases of prior studies, including body satisfaction (using a modified Body Image Scale) and social contextual factors. Hierarchical regressions were conducted to test the hypothesis that after accounting for demographic variables and social contextual aspects (i.e., body satisfaction, social dysphoria, and fetishization), medical transition (i.e., hormone therapy) would not significantly predict five outcomes of sexual experience (i.e., receptive penetration, insertive penetration, importance of sex, sexual pleasure, and sexual intimacy). Across all models, medical transition was not a significant predictor of sexual experiences; however, sexual orientation, age, body satisfaction, and experiences of fetishization were frequent predictors. Results suggest that the sexual experiences of TFNB individuals do not align with the medicalized model and that demographic and contextual factors play an important role in the sexual outcomes for this population.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21f305bc983ccb2d87dd841f2c084872866ebf02

Due to this relatively new introduction, the integration of wind energy is often not optimized. Moreover, owing to the technical constraints and transmission congestions of the power network, most of the wind energy has to be curtailed. Due to various factors that influence the connectivity of wind energy, this paper proposes a well-organized posterior multi-objective (MO) optimization algorithm for maximizing the connections of wind energy. In this regard, the dynamic thermal rating (DTR) system and the static VAR compensator (SVC) have been identified as effective tools for improving the loadability of the network. The propose MO algorithm in this paper aims to minimize: (1) wind energy curtailment, (2) operation cost of the network considering all investments and operations, also known as the total social cost, and (3) SVC operation cost. The proposed MO problem was solved using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) II and it was tested on the modified IEEE reliability test system (IEEE-RTS). The results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm in aiding power system enhancement planning for integrating wind energy.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/392fe86cb119fd689e6b19ac9a41c33cf1b1318d

Controlling for common explanations in the literature, we conduct a cross-national, time-series analysis of up to 151 countries from 2000 to 2019 to assess the impact of social media penetration on domestic terrorism. We ﬁnd that greater social media penetration increases the likelihood of domestic terrorism in countries as it supports extremists’ ability to recruit, mobilize, and train terrorists. Using mediation analysis, we also find that greater social media penetration amplifies online and political polarization, increasing the likelihood of domestic terrorism events.

In recent years, the rapid rise of the divorce rate in China, a country where the divorce rate had previously been low, has attracted wide attention. However, few articles have focused on the popularization of information and communication technology's impact on China’s rising divorce rate in recent years. As a first attempt, the provincial panel data during the period 2001–2016 is applied to study quantitatively the relationship between mobile phone penetration and the divorce rate. In order to get more reliable estimation results, this paper uses two indicators to measure the divorce rate, and quantile regression is applied for further analysis. Additionally, one-year to five-year lag times of the mobile phone penetration are used as the core explanatory variables in order to analyse the lagging effect of mobile phone penetration on divorce rate. The result shows that the correlation between the mobile phone penetration and the divorce rate was statistically positive significant in China during the period 2001–2016. Furthermore, the paper also finds that mobile phone penetration had the greatest impact on divorce rate in central China, followed by eastern China, but it was not obvious in western China during this period. From a technological perspective, this paper provides some possible explanations for the rising divorce rate in China in recent years, and further enriches the relevant research on the impact of the development of information and communication technology on societal changes.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/361816c535300334d949dfa2a091d610055fa097

However, the market of single- and two-family houses is characterized by low return rates for excess power injected to the grid, and the installation of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) is sensitive to financial incentives. We assess the drivers influencing the diffusion of rooftop solar PV systems until 2050, by employing an agent-based model. An agent is a single- or two-family house, and its decision to invest depends on the economic profitability of the investment, the agent’s income, environmental benefits (injunctive social norm), awareness and knowledge about the solar PV technology, and the impact of the social network (descriptive social norm). The model includes a synthetic population of agents, statistically equivalent to the true population. We also investigate the impact of different support policies, technology learning rates, electricity prices, and discount rates on the investment decision. We find that the concept of prosumer emerges, mainly via self-consumption strategies. The diffusion process of rooftop solar PV systems in single- and two-family houses gains momentum in the future. In the near-term, PV deployment is sensitive to the profitability of the investment, while after the year 2030, peer effects play an increasing role in the agents’ investment decisions.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9edc32d6bf2ab22304cfb0b1da46515582e06517

Toward this goal, day-ahead stochastic market clearing with high-penetration wind energy is pursued in this paper based on the DC optimal power flow (OPF). The objective is to minimize the social cost which consists of conventional generation costs, end-user disutility, as well as a risk measure of the system re-dispatching cost. Capitalizing on the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), the novel model is able to mitigate the potentially high risk of the recourse actions to compensate wind forecast errors. The resulting convex optimization task is tackled via a distribution-free sample average based approximation to bypass the prohibitively complex high-dimensional integration. Furthermore, to cope with possibly large-scale dispatchable loads, a fast distributed solver is developed with guaranteed convergence using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

However, in medicine and health care, a large number of stakeholders (eg, clinicians, administrators, professional colleges, academic institutions, ministries of health, among others) are unaware of social media’s relevance, potential applications in their day-to-day activities, as well as the inherent risks and how these may be attenuated and mitigated. Objective We conducted a narrative review with the aim to present case studies that illustrate how, where, and why social media are being used in the medical and health care sectors. Methods Using a critical-interpretivist framework, we used qualitative methods to synthesize the impact and illustrate, explain, and provide contextual knowledge of the applications and potential implementations of social media in medicine and health care. Both traditional (eg, peer-reviewed) and nontraditional (eg, policies, case studies, and social media content) sources were used, in addition to an environmental scan (using Google and Bing Web searches) of resources. Results We reviewed, evaluated, and synthesized 76 articles, 44 websites, and 11 policies/reports. Results and case studies are presented according to 10 different categories of social media: (1) blogs (eg, WordPress), (2) microblogs (eg, Twitter), (3) social networking sites (eg, Facebook), (4) professional networking sites (eg, LinkedIn, Sermo), (5) thematic networking sites (eg, 23andMe), (6) wikis (eg, Wikipedia), (7) mashups (eg, HealthMap), (8) collaborative filtering sites (eg, Digg), (9) media sharing sites (eg, YouTube, Slideshare), and others (eg, SecondLife). Four recommendations are provided and explained for stakeholders wishing to engage with social media while attenuating risk: (1) maintain professionalism at all times, (2) be authentic, have fun, and do not be afraid, (3) ask for help, and (4) focus, grab attention, and engage. Conclusions The role of social media in the medical and health care sectors is far reaching, and many questions in terms of governance, ethics, professionalism, privacy, confidentiality, and information quality remain unanswered. By following the guidelines presented, professionals have a starting point to engage with social media in a safe and ethical manner.

For decades, spatial scientists have researched place connectivity, applications, and metrics. The growing popularity of social media provides a new data stream where spatial social interaction measures are largely devoid of privacy issues, easily assessable, and harmonized. In this study, we introduced a global multi-scale place connectivity index (PCI) based on spatial interactions among places revealed by geotagged tweets as a spatiotemporal-continuous and easy-to-implement measurement. The multi-scale PCI, demonstrated at the US county level, exhibits a strong positive association with SafeGraph population movement records (10% penetration in the US population) and Facebook’s social connectedness index (SCI), a popular connectivity index based on social networks. We found that PCI has a strong boundary effect and that it generally follows the distance decay, although this force is weaker in more urbanized counties with a denser population. Our investigation further suggests that PCI has great potential in addressing real-world problems that require place connectivity knowledge, exemplified with two applications: (1) modeling the spatial spread of COVID-19 during the early stage of the pandemic and (2) modeling hurricane evacuation destination choice.

Out of these 560 million Internet users in India, almost 375 million people use social media. These facts are enough to highlight the deep penetration of Internet and social media in Indian society. This deep penetration of social media among the Indian workers has further more deepened in the era of COVID-19. The employees are working from home, so they are more prone to use mobile and social media platforms for non-work-related purposes. It is a proven fact that social media has not only impacted our personal lives but also professional lives in more than one ways. Despite the previously mentioned staggering figures which show the deep penetration of Internet and social media in our Indian society, sufficient studies/researches have not been conducted to study the impact of social media on our professional lives. Keeping in mind these things, the purpose of this study is to understand the impact of social media on one of the most crucial aspects of our professional lives, i.e., labour productivity which is quite crucial not only for the success of individuals and business organizations but also for the economic growth of any country. This study also tries to highlight the other related aspects of social media usage at workplace like the perception of the employees regarding use of social media at workplace, purpose for which social media is being used by the employees and other such related issues. Primary data have been used in this study; collected through a survey from the professionals/employees who hail from different sectors/industries. The authors have used convenient sampling method to collect data to examine the impact of social media usage on the productivity of the employees in the era of COVID-19. The findings of this study offer practical insights about the various impacts of social media on work life of the employees and how their working lives have changed while working from home in the era of COVID-19. This study also offers suggestions about harnessing the benefits and minimizing the side-effects of social media usage at workplace. Both the employees and the organizations can equally take advantage of this report.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e7d3084d75334aff9be2f61a63aa3c69293a592

Wong",2020,2020-02-03,"",42,Semantic Scholar,"The purpose of this paper is to synthesize a dyadic theoretical model which takes social-oriented and individual-initiative drivers into account and illustrates a mechanism between social commerce intention and its antecedents in the hospitality industry. To understand tourist social commerce behaviors, the current study puts forward a comprehensive model and investigates the impact among social support, social capital, participant involvement and social identification on tourist propensity to engage in social commerce with behaviors such as to like, share, post reviews and make purchases.,The current research draws on social exchange theory and social penetration theory to study how social-oriented drivers (i.e., social support and social capital) and individual-initiated drivers (i.e., participant involvement and social identification) could better explain tourists’ social commerce intentions. Structural equation modeling was performed based on a sample of 569 hotel guests from 61 hotels in Macau.,Results reveal that social capital mediates the relationship between social support and social commerce behavioral intention. This chain of relationship is moderated by social identification in that the more a hotel guest identifies himself/herself as an in-group member of an online community, the more likely he/she would engage in social commerce behaviors.,The diffusion velocity of marketing effect is manifested through customers’ social commerce intentions and behaviors, which helps managers to identify the importance in maintaining a supportive atmosphere to nurture intimate member-to-member and member-to-provider relationships.,The present study enriches the social penetration theory and social exchange theory by showing how both individual and social perspectives could jointly influence hotel guest propensity to post likes and comments and to reserve hotel rooms, as means to build more intimate relationships with the members within a virtual community.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f382e76e0c0de19e598d96f76f0a9154e752d9c

It is perceived that a mix of religious reasons and propaganda by anti-vaccination groups on social media are lowering the vaccination coverage in Malappuram district of Kerala. We undertook a qualitative study to understand the factors responsible for generating and perpetuating vaccine hesitancy, the pathways of trust deficit in immunization programs and the interaction between various social media actors. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted among parents/caregivers, physicians, public sector health staff, alternative system medical practitioners, field healthcare workers and teachers in areas with highest and lowest vaccination coverage in the district, as well as with communication experts. The trust deficit between parents/caregivers and healthcare providers is created by multiple factors, such as providers’ lack of technical knowledge, existing patriarchal societal norms and critical views of vaccine by naturopaths and homeopaths. Anti-vaccine groups use social media to influence caregivers' perceptions and beliefs. Religion does not appear to play a major role in creating vaccine resistance in this setting. A long-term, multipronged strategy should be adopted to address the trust deficit. In the short to medium term, the health sector can focus on appropriate and targeted vaccine-related communication strategies, including the use of infographics, soft skills training for healthcare workers, technical competency improvement through a mobile application-based repository of information and creation of a media cell to monitor vaccine-related conversations in social media and to intervene if needed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b74af9b2fe382d81e1b7075b99fde5ccbf54f30

But leaders are also active on social media. They use their accounts to communicate with domestic and international audiences. By the end of 2014, more than 76 percent of world leaders had an active presence on social media. What explains variation in their adoption and use of social media? We look at several different potential hypotheses: higher income per capita and internet penetration (modernization), social pressure, level of democratization, and geographic spread of adoption (diffusion). We find strong support that (1) increased political pressure from social unrest and (2) higher levels of democratization correlate with leader adoption of social media platforms. Although our findings are correlational, they reveal that institutional and political pressures are related to social media adoption and the political communication of world leaders.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/037de2bc65de9d744721f0be74b32864fe8ddedd

Investigating Situational Awareness in Social and Print Media during the Second COVID-19 Wave in India","Ishita Vohra; Meher Shashwat Nigam; Aryan Sakaria; Amey Kudari; N. Rangaswamy",2022,2022-11-10,"International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining",5,Semantic Scholar,"The COVID-19 pandemic required efficient allocation of public resources and transforming existing ways of societal functions. To manage any crisis, governments and public health researchers ex-ploit the information available to them in order to make informed decisions, also defined as situational awareness. Gathering situational awareness using so-cial media, has been functional to manage epidemics. Previous research focused on using discussions during periods of epidemic crises on social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Facebook and developing NLP techniques to filter out important/relevant discussions from a huge corpus of messages and posts. Social media usage varies with internet penetration and other socio-economic factors, which might induce disparity in an-alyzing discussions across different geographies. How-ever, print media is a ubiquitous information source, irrespective of geography. Further, topics discussed in news articles are already ‘newsworthy’, while on social media ‘newsworthiness' is a product of techno-social processes. Developing this fundamental difference, we study Twitter data during the second wave in India focused on six high-population cities with varied macro-economic factors. Through a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods, we further analyze two Indian newspapers during the same period and compare topics from both Twitter and the newspapers to evaluate sit-uational awareness around the second phase of COVID on each of these platforms. We conclude that factors like internet penetration and GDP in a specific city influence the discourse surrounding situational updates on social media. Thus, augmenting information from newspapers to information extracted from social media would provide a more comprehensive perspective in resource-deficit cities",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cbd9145b4decbb4338ccf445c18b14e125fdd837
